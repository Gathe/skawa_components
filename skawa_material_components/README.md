## More "Material" Components

These components are based on Material Design and built on top of `package:angular_components`. 

The goal is to provide a couple of components that seem to be missing from angular_components.

**Currently Available components:**

* ✓ `<skawa-card>`
* ✓ `<skawa-data-table>`
* ✓ `<skawa-grid>`
* ✓ `<skawa-snackbar>`

Both packages are being actively maintained, meaning components get added and removed.
In case of a component from this list is added to angular_components, it will be 
deprecated and eventually removed from skawa_material_components.

**Removed components:**

* ✓ `<skawa-appbar>`
* ✓ `<skawa-drawer>`
* ✓ `<skawa-sidebar>`
